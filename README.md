# Contribution-Guidelines
A set of contribution guidelines for personal projects.

## Coding Style ##
* ### Bash ###
  * __Spacing__
    * Indents are 2 spaces and tabs are forbidden.

* ### C ###
  * __Comments__
    * Comments should be as short as possible and not contain jokes or vulgarity.
    * Avoid ending a comment in punctuation.
    * Comments must go on the line above the code or block of code that it documents.
    * Comments should not ever contain emoji.
    * Always begin comments with a capital letter.
    * Comments will always use the multiline comment syntax, even if it is only a single line.
    * Comments must not contain references to religion, politics, or other personal beliefs.

  * __Conditionals__
    * Parentheses only need a space before them in conditional constructs.
    * Each case should be at the same indent level as the switch statement.
    * Else statements start on the same line as the closing curly brace of the if statement.
    * Single line if and else statements must have curly braces.

  * __Naming__
    * Camel case is strictly forbidden.
    * Underscores are used to separate words when naming variables or functions.
    * Variable and function names should not have more than 4 underscores in them.
    * Stars in pointers are a prefix to the variable name, not a suffix to the type.
    * Variable and function names must not contain references to religion, politics, or other personal beliefs.
    * Variable and function names that require underscores must separate each underscore with letters or numbers.
    * Under no circumstances should variable or function names contain emoji.
    * Variable and function names must never contain jokes or vulgarity.
    * An underscore must never succeed another underscore in variable and function names.

  * __Spacing__
    * Indents are 8 spaces and tabs are forbidden.
    * The 80 character limit is a guideline, not a rule.
    * If a line becomes too long, find ways to extend it vertically.
    * Comma-separated function argument lists that extend too far must have each argument on a separate line.
    * Except in the case of function declarations, curly braces always open on the same line.

## Commits ##

* The purpose of the commit should always be clearly defined in the commit message.
